# Implementation status — 2 November 2026

Playable candidate: **0.9.1 — Responsive Firing**, developed on
`fix/firing-response` from the released v0.9.0 baseline and merged product roadmap.
The combat ruleset and fighter/CPU parameters remain v0.8.0.

The v0.9.1 candidate uses an existing charge pose to acknowledge accepted normal
shots for five fighters whose Shoot clip began in an idle pose. All 90 sampled
tap trials respond visibly on frame 2. The Mastery menu description fits within
the viewport, and player controls list the Practice Arena row. See
[response validation](RESPONSIVE_FIRING_TEST_REPORT.md).

The native game includes nine animated Pokémon, elemental attacks and sounds,
stamina, hit-earned supers, follow-ups and fighter traits, three CPU difficulties,
Practice, Quick Battle, five-rival Arcade, two continues, champion/records screens,
original menu music, audio controls and an animated Poké Ball recall.

v0.9 adds Volcanic and Shoreline alongside Woodland. Quick Battle and Practice
select an arena; Arcade rotates through all three with a consistent arena on
retries. Arena motion stays above the combat plane and stops outside fighting.
Floor, HUD geometry, hitboxes and combat randomness remain consistent.

Fighter Mastery is a seventh visible mode button. Each fighter earns cosmetic
medals for 10 damaging follow-ups, 5 successful super evasions and a no-continue
Arcade clear at any difficulty. Roster badges and result feedback show progress.
Practice cannot award mastery. The observer never mutates CombatCore.

Recoverable dual-copy SRAM schema 3 stores two bounded mastery counters per
fighter in 420-byte copies at the existing offsets. Earlier schema-1 and schema-2
records/audio settings migrate, and old no-continue clears count immediately.
Steps save at round end, Rematch or leaving a fight; abrupt power-off can lose
unsaved current-match steps. Mid-run resume remains outside scope.

The source contract is [ARENAS_AND_MASTERY.md](ARENAS_AND_MASTERY.md). Validation is
recorded in [ARENAS_AND_MASTERY_TEST_REPORT.md](ARENAS_AND_MASTERY_TEST_REPORT.md)
and verification/v0.9.0/. See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for reproduction commands.
Historical documents and ROM-bound reports remain under their original versions.

Human matchup testing, physical GBA hardware, non-Linux builds and graphical
editor open/save behavior remain unverified. No human balance claim is made.
GitHub publication follows the existing feature-branch/PR workflow.
